# Patch ledger — read path

Every accumulated patch in `retrieval/` + `application/`, mapped to the failure
it fixed, whether it is load-bearing (preserve) or scar tissue (shed), and the
clean home that should own it after the rewrite.

**Disposition legend**

- **DERIVE** — delete the hardcode; the graph already holds this (traverse it).
- **FOLD** — behaviour is real but belongs inside one shared abstraction
  (`RetrievalPlan` / an expander), not a bespoke call site.
- **KEEP** — load-bearing and correct; relocate behind a clean interface, logic
  unchanged.
- **DELETE** — subsumed or redundant once the above land; verify with the net.

Verdict on "scar tissue vs domain knowledge" is **empirical**: remove it, run
the regression net, see if anything regresses. Rows below are the hypothesis.

## A. The five overlapping "pull more provisions" mechanisms

These are the heart of the debt: each independently fetches extra provisions and
dedups locally (`_merge_unique_provisions` is called from several sites). They
should collapse into **one** `RetrievalPlan` that selects seeds + an ordered set
of idempotent expanders under one budget and one dedup.

| # | Patch | Location | Failure it fixed | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `_retrieve_route_provisions` (route-branched retrieval) | `_retrieval.py:370` (~400 LOC of `if route.id == …`) | Different question types need different seeds/expansions | **FOLD** → routes become thin *policies* selecting expanders; the branching dissolves |
| A2 | Obligation-backbone force-retrieval (`_get_obligation_backbone_refs`) | `_retrieval.py:231` + `_OBLIGATION_MASTER_ARTICLES` `_config.py:203` | Role obligation questions missed the statutory anchor articles | **DERIVE** → `RoleExpander` traverses `OBLIGATION_OF` from the role node |
| A3 | AI-Act high-risk backbone (`_AI_ACT_HIGH_RISK_BACKBONE_REFS`) | `_retrieval.py:69` | Class-IIb-SaMD benchmark: obligation cluster not retrieved when `role_specs` empty | **DERIVE** → `ReasoningChainExpander` from the high-risk seed via `TRIGGERS_OBLIGATION_CLUSTER` |
| A4 | Corrective retrieval pass (`_run_corrective_retrieval_pass`) | `_retrieval.py:1006` | Selected route retrieved insufficient evidence | **FOLD** → re-run `RetrievalPlan` with added seeds; not a parallel codepath |
| A5 | Audit gap-retrieve (`_gap_retrieve`) | `_audit.py:244` | Auditor names a missing provision/topic to close a backbone gap | **FOLD** → same `RetrievalPlan` re-run; auditor supplies seeds, not a private retriever path |
| A6 | Definition anchor force-injection (`_ANCHOR_DEFINITION_TERMS`) | `_definitions.py:28` | Short foundational terms ("ai system") lost the 15-term cap race → training-memory fallback | **FOLD** → `DefinitionExpander` with priority for in-scope subject-matter anchors |

> Once A1–A6 share one plan + one dedup, the "redundant patches working against
> CRSS" the rewrite targets largely disappear. Net check: the
> Class-IIb-SaMD case must retrieve the same obligation cluster via A2/A3's
> graph-derived expanders as the hardcoded lists do today.

> **A2 — empirical proof (TC_011, post-reset baseline).** Question: *"baseline
> obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models"* (GPAI = Art 3(63)).
> The graph is complete: `provider` role `OBLIGATION_OF` → {Art 4, 16, 50, 51,
> **53**, 54, **55**, 88, 94}, and Art 3(63) exists as both Provision and
> DefinedTerm. Yet the captured retrieval bag is {50, 51, 54, 88, 94, Annex XI}
> — **Art 53 (the centerpiece GPAI-provider obligation) and Art 55 (systemic
> risk) are dropped**, and the Art 3(63) definition anchor is absent. The role
> traversal runs (50/51/54 are role obligations) but lets its `OBLIGATION_OF`
> targets compete in the k=8 vector bag, so 53/55 truncate out. This regressed
> from the pre-reset baseline (which had Art 53) purely because the richer
> rebuild — 813→1164 `OBLIGATION_OF` — surfaced more competitors at the k
> boundary. **Conclusion: TC_011 is a retrieval-path truncation, not a graph
> gap.** The A2 RoleExpander (role obligations are *guaranteed seeds*, never
> vector-truncated) + A6 DefinitionExpander (pin the in-scope defined term) fix
> it directly; the old hardcoded backbone was masking it by force-injecting 53.

## B. Hardcoded knowledge that the graph already holds

The strongest signal that canonicalization was under-plugged. Each is a Python
table duplicating graph edges.

| # | Patch | Location | What it really is | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `_OBLIGATION_MASTER_ARTICLES` `(role,celex)→[articles]` | `_config.py:203` | `OBLIGATION_OF` edge data, hand-transcribed | **DERIVE** from `ActorRole` → `OBLIGATION_OF` |

> **B1 — empirical verdict (graph diff, captured run).** `OBLIGATION_OF`
> traversal reproduces *or exceeds* the hardcode for **9 of 13** `(role,celex)`
> pairs (provider → 9 articles incl. 16+53; MDR manufacturer → 26). It does **not**
> for 4 — these are genuine canonicalization gaps the table was masking:
> - GDPR `controller` / `processor`: the `ActorRole` nodes **don't exist** →
>   zero `OBLIGATION_OF` edges (`role_linker` never created GDPR roles).
> - MDR & IVDR `authorised representative`: node exists but `Article 11` (its
>   core duties) is unlinked.
> So B1 is ~70% scar tissue, ~30% band-aid. The correct fix is to **complete the
> graph** (create the GDPR roles + link AR Art 11 in `role_linker`), then delete
> the table — not to delete the table over a still-incomplete graph.
| B2 | `_AI_ACT_HIGH_RISK_BACKBONE_REFS` flat article list | `_retrieval.py:69` | The high-risk obligation cluster | **DERIVE** from reasoning-chain edges (`TRIGGERS_OBLIGATION_CLUSTER`) |
| B3 | `_GATE_ARTICLES` (classification-chain gate refs) | `_retrieval.py:481` | Entry seeds for the classification traversal | **DERIVE / KEEP-as-seed-config** — small, may stay as a seed policy if not edge-backed |
| B4 | `_IMPLICIT_PROVISION_REFS` (keyword→canonical ref) | `_config.py:238` | Topic→provision shortcuts (lawful basis→Art 6, etc.) | **KEEP** (relocate) — genuine lexical shortcuts, not graph-derivable; small + tested |

> B1 + B2 are the prize: deleting them and proving the graph traversal
> reproduces the obligation set is the single most validating step of the
> rewrite, and it finally connects `reasoning_linker` / `role_linker` output to
> retrieval.

## C. Post-hoc validation self-checks (generation guardrails)

These run *after* generation and are healthy in principle, but each is a
separately bolted-on, env-flagged stage. They belong in one `verify.py` stage
over the typed `Evidence` set.

| # | Patch | Location / flag | Purpose | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Faithfulness check (fabricated/near) | `_faithfulness.py`, `CRSS_FAITHFULNESS_CHECK` | Redact ungrounded quotes | **KEEP** → into `verify.py` |
| C2 | Attribution guard (concatenation/misattribution) | `_faithfulness.py`, this session | Catch grounded-but-displaced text | **KEEP** → into `verify.py`; first brick of proof-carrying answers |
| C3 | Backbone self-check | `agent.py:803`, `CRSS_BACKBONE_SELFCHECK` | Validate the obligation backbone is present | **KEEP/REVIEW** — may be redundant once backbone is graph-derived (A2/A3) |
| C4 | Citation-scope check | `agent.py:848`, `CRSS_CITATION_SCOPE_CHECK` | Flag cited refs absent from context | **KEEP** → into `verify.py` |
| C5 | Confidence scoring | `_confidence.py` | 5-component composite | **KEEP** → reads `Evidence` provenance directly |
| C6 | Ask-first scope gate | `_scoping.py`, `CRSS_CLARIFY` | Clarify missing decisive actor role | **KEEP** → into `scenario.py` (it is a scenario-completeness check) |

---

## D. Config sprawl

| # | Patch | Location | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Per-line context-trim knobs (`CRSS_CHILD_CHARS`, `CRSS_CITE_CHARS`, `CRSS_INTERP_CHARS`, `CRSS_*_LINES`, `CRSS_TRIM_THRESHOLD`) | `_context.py` | **DELETE/CONSOLIDATE** → one context-budget policy on the `Evidence` renderer |
| D2 | Model overrides (`CRSS_HYDE_MODEL`, `CRSS_REWRITE_MODEL`, `CRSS_AUDIT_MODEL`, `CRSS_JUDGE_MODEL`) | various | **KEEP** — legitimate operational config |
| D3 | Channel toggles (`CRSS_LEXICAL`, `CRSS_RERANKER`) | `graph_retriever.py` | **KEEP** — belong on the retrieval core |

---

## Headline targets (highest validation value, do first)

1. **Collapse A1–A6 into one `RetrievalPlan` + one dedup.** Removes the
   redundancy directly named in the rewrite motivation.
2. **DERIVE B1 + B2 from the graph.** Deletes the biggest hardcoded tables and
   connects the under-used canonicalization edges — the "not properly plugged
   in" fix.
3. **Unify C1–C5 into `verify.py`** over a typed `Evidence` object — and make
   the `Provision` dict a real dataclass (the ad-hoc dict shape is what let the
   faithfulness corpus silently drift earlier).
